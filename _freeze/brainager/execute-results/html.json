The examples in the kit rely on `bash` and `R`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFundamentally `brainager` calculations are about producing an estimated age based on measurable characteristics of a brain image, such as regional variations in gray matter density. The difference between estimated and chronological age is often referred to in the literature as the \"brain age gap\" (BAG) or \"predicted age difference\" (PAD), and is usually expressed as estimated minus chronological age. This value is often interpreted as an indicator of brain health.\n\n## Starting Project\n\n### Locate data\n\nIn the release folder, data are stored underneath the `mris/derivatives` folder:\n\n```bash\n/corral-secure/projects/A2CPS/products/consortium-data/pre-surgery/mris/derivatives/brainager\n```\n\n### Extract data\n\nData for each participant are stored in a sub-directory.\n\n```bash\n$ ls | head\nsub-10003\nsub-10005\nsub-10008\nsub-10010\nsub-10011\nsub-10013\nsub-10014\nsub-10015\nsub-10017\nsub-10020\n```\n\nFor example[^tree]:\n\n[^tree]: The `tree` command is just used here to display the folder structure, and is not required for you to have.\n\n```bash\n$ tree sub-10319\nsub-10319\n└── ses-V1\n├── slicesdir_sub-10319_ses-V1_T1w.nii\n│   ├── index.html\n│   ├── _tmp_tmph17ksnl8_c1sub-10319_ses-V1_T1w.png\n│   ├── _tmp_tmph17ksnl8_c2sub-10319_ses-V1_T1w.png\n│   ├── _tmp_tmph17ksnl8_c3sub-10319_ses-V1_T1w.png\n│   ├── _tmp_tmph17ksnl8_smwc1sub-10319_ses-V1_T1w.png\n│   ├── _tmp_tmph17ksnl8_smwc2sub-10319_ses-V1_T1w.png\n│   └── _tmp_tmph17ksnl8_smwc3sub-10319_ses-V1_T1w.png\n├── sub-10319_ses-V1_T1w.m\n├── sub-10319_ses-V1_T1w_tissue_volumes.tsv\n└── sub-10319_ses-V1_T1w.tsv\n\n2 directories, 10 files\n\n```\n\n\nMost users will be interested in the predicted ages, which can be found in `sub-[recordid]/ses-[protocolid]/sub-[recordid]_ses-[protocolid]_T1w.tsv`. For example\n\n\n```bash\n$ cat sub-10003/ses-V1/sub-10003_ses-V1_T1w.tsv \nFile\tbrain.predicted_age\tlower.CI\tupper.CI\nsub-10003_ses-V1_T1w\t73.6037\t72.9683\t74.2392\n```\n\nHere is an example of how these files could be loaded using `R`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# list all files\nfiles <- fs::dir_ls(\"data/brainager\", glob = \"*T1w.tsv\", recurse = TRUE)\n\n# read in all tsvs\nages <- readr::read_tsv(files)\nages\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1,017 × 4\n   File                 brain.predicted_age lower.CI upper.CI\n   <chr>                              <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>\n 1 sub-10003_ses-V1_T1w                73.6     73.0     74.2\n 2 sub-10005_ses-V1_T1w                65.7     64.6     66.9\n 3 sub-10008_ses-V1_T1w                75.5     74.7     76.3\n 4 sub-10010_ses-V1_T1w                44.6     42.6     46.5\n 5 sub-10011_ses-V1_T1w                40.5     38.5     42.4\n 6 sub-10013_ses-V1_T1w                72.1     71.5     72.8\n 7 sub-10014_ses-V1_T1w                42.3     41.7     42.9\n 8 sub-10015_ses-V1_T1w                55.0     53.2     56.8\n 9 sub-10017_ses-V1_T1w                57.9     57.2     58.7\n10 sub-10020_ses-V1_T1w                59.2     58.6     59.7\n# ℹ 1,007 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe column `File` identifies the anatomical image that was used for to make the prediction.

However, A2CPS Releases 1.0.0, 1.1.0, and 2.0.0 have not included raw T1w files for privacy reasons, and thus the end result may differ from the released version, which was generated on the raw images.\n\n[^docker]: The container used by A2CPS is available [here](https://github.com/a2cps/mri_imaging_pipeline/blob/master/brainager_app/Dockerfile).\n\n### Variability Across Scanners\n\nMany MRI biomarkers exhibit variability across the scanners, which may confound some analyses. For an up-to-date assessment of the issue and overview of current thinking, please see [Confluence](https://a2cps.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/176619539/Imaging+Harmonization). \n\n\n### Data Quality\n\nAs with any MRI derivative, all pipeline derivatives have been included. This means that products were included regardless of their quality, and so some products may have been generated from images that are known to have poor quality---rated \"red\", or incomparable. For details on the ratings and how to exclude them, see @sec-rawdata-mri-qc-joining. Additionally, extensive QC has not yet been performed on the derivatives themselves, and so there may be cases where pipelines produced atypical outputs. For an overview of planned checks, see [Confluence](https://a2cps.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/262471688/Image+Processing+Checks). \n\n\n### Calculating the Brain Age Gap\n\nPredicted ages are neat, but these values are most useful when compared against a participant's chronological age. These can be found in the `demographics` portion of the release.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbaseline_ages <- read_csv(\n  \"data/demographics/demographics-2025-01-10.csv\",\n  col_select = c(\"record_id\", \"age\")\n)\n\nbrainage <- ages_with_sub |>\n  left_join(baseline_ages, by = join_by(sub == record_id)) |>\n  mutate(\n    brain_age_gap = brain.predicted_age - age\n  ) |>\n  filter(!is.na(age)) # age not available for all participants\nbrainage\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 996 × 7\n   File          brain.predicted_age lower.CI upper.CI   sub   age brain_age_gap\n   <chr>                       <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>         <dbl>\n 1 sub-10003_se…                73.6     73.0     74.2 10003    73         0.604\n 2 sub-10005_se…                65.7     64.6     66.9 10005    58         7.73 \n 3 sub-10008_se…                75.5     74.7     76.3 10008    73         2.49 \n 4 sub-10010_se…                44.6     42.6     46.5 10010    64       -19.4  \n 5 sub-10011_se…                40.5     38.5     42.4 10011    54       -13.5  \n 6 sub-10013_se…                72.1     71.5     72.8 10013    71         1.14 \n 7 sub-10014_se…                42.3     41.7     42.9 10014    45        -2.70 \n 8 sub-10015_se…                55.0     53.2     56.8 10015    65        -9.98 \n 9 sub-10017_se…                57.9     57.2     58.7 10017    56         1.95 \n10 sub-10020_se…                59.2     58.6     59.7 10020    53         6.17 \n# ℹ 986 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBy plotting the predicted ages against the true ages, we can review the accuracy of the predictions.\n\n\n::: {.cell caption='Predicted and Chronological Age.

The values that have been pre-calculated for A2CPS are derived from a model that has been around for a while and used successfully in a variety of studies [@clausen_assessment_2022; @hobday_tissue_2022; @biondo_brain_2022]. For some analyses, it may be worthwhile to assess whether results persist across different models. For pain studies, one successful model has been DeepBrainNet [@valdes_brain_2023; @montesino_brain_2023; @bashyam_mri_2020], which can be used with derivatives from fMRIPrep.\n\n### Methods\n\nFor additional documentation on the files and a detailed description of the methods, please see the official [brainageR repo](https://github.com/james-cole/brainageR). \n\n### Citations\n\nIf you use the brainageR materials, please follow the instructions for citing the brainageR package: https://github.com/james-cole/brainageR?tab=readme-ov-file#citations.\n\nIn publications or presentations including data from A2CPS, please include the following statement as attribution:\n\n> Data were provided [in part] by the A2CPS Consortium funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund, which is managed by the Office of the Director (OD)/ Office of Strategic Coordination (OSC).

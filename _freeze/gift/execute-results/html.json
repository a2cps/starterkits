These components can be thought of as functional brain networks. For functional connectivity research, the timeseries of these ICA-derived networks are often correlated with each other to assess inter-network correlations, enabling investigators to study how these independent brain systems interact and communicate with one another.\n\nIntrinsic functional connectivity networks within the resting-state fMRI data were estimated with NeuroMark [@du_neuromark_2020] using the Group ICA of fMRI Toolbox ([GIFT](http://trendscenter.org/software/gift)). NeuroMark is an automated and adaptive independent component analysis pipeline that uses group ICA-based templates as spatial priors to guide the identification of subject-specific independent component networks and the extraction of network features (e.g., timecourses, functional connectivity within and between networks, graph theoretic measures). For full details on the output and methods of GIFT, please refer to [the toolbox documentation](https://github.com/trendscenter/gift). \n\nNote: if all you need are estimates of functional connectivity between ICA components, please see the MRI Image Derived Phenotype table, `mris/idp/mri.{tsv,json}`. Here, we outline how A2CPS structures the outputs and highlight a few key files that may be helpful for custom analyses (e.g., estimating dynamic connectivity). \n\n### Locate Data\n\nOn TACC, the neuroimaging data are stored underneath the releases. For example, data release v2.#.# is underneath\n\n```bash\npre-surgery/mris\n```\n\n\nThe GIFT derivatives are underneath `mris/derivatives/gift`. This structure follows the [BIDS method of storing derived datasets](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common-principles.html#storage-of-derived-datasets). Inputs to GIFT are stored underneath the top-level \"sub-[recordid]\" directories. \n\n```bash\n$ tree mris/derivatives/gift/sub-10003\ngift/sub-10003\n└── ses-V1\n    └── func\n        ├── sub-10003_ses-V1_task-cuff_run-01_bold.nii.gz\n        ├── sub-10003_ses-V1_task-rest_run-01_bold.nii.gz\n        └── sub-10003_ses-V1_task-rest_run-02_bold.nii.gz\n```\n\nThese files are copies of the outputs of fmriprep. Specifically, they are are [files matching `*space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_res-2_desc-preproc*`](https://github.com/a2cps/biomarker-extractor/blob/4cc5c52a861b30fe9bdb5e728084b0785e01b71a/src/biomarkers/entrypoints/gift.py#L111-L125).\n\nThe GIFT derivatives are underneath the subfolder \"derivatives\".\n\n```bash\n$ ls mris/derivatives/gift/derivatives/\ngift-neuromark_fmri_2.0_modelorder-175  gift-neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi\n```\n\nWe provide results from two different NeuroMark network templates (alternatively called \"model\"). Templates are the spatial priors that were used in the estimation of ICA components. The first is NeuroMark 2.0 (model order = 175) which includes 58 non-artifactual components produced from a single model order of 175 components [@iraji_identifying_2023]. The second is the multi-scale NeuroMark 2.1 which includes 105 non-artifactual components covering diverse spatial scales which are aggregated from diverse model orders [@iraji_identifying_2023]. A typical analysis will involve only one model. Without a specific reason to prefer one template, the 2.1, multi-order model is recommended. For additional details on the templates, please see this [page of references](https://trendscenter.org/data/).\n\nThe model directories are themselves organized according to BIDS.\n\n```bash\n$ ls mris/derivatives/gift/derivatives/gift-neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi | head\nderivatives\nsub-10003\nsub-10008\nsub-10010\nsub-10011\nsub-10013\nsub-10015\nsub-10017\nsub-10020\nsub-10023\n```\n\n### Extract Data\n\nIn each of these sub-[recordid] folders, GIFT outputs the spatial IC maps and timecourses for each run.\n\n```bash\n$ tree mris/derivatives/gift/derivatives/gift-neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi/sub-10003\nmris/derivatives/gift/derivatives/gift-neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi/sub-10003\n└── ses-V1\n    └── func\n        ├── sub-10003_ses-V1_task-cuff_run-01_bold_ic_maps.nii.gz\n        ├── sub-10003_ses-V1_task-cuff_run-01_bold_timecourses.nii.gz\n        ├── sub-10003_ses-V1_task-rest_run-01_bold_ic_maps.nii.gz\n        ├── sub-10003_ses-V1_task-rest_run-01_bold_timecourses.nii.gz\n        ├── sub-10003_ses-V1_task-rest_run-02_bold_ic_maps.nii.gz\n        └── sub-10003_ses-V1_task-rest_run-02_bold_timecourses.nii.gz\n```\n\nThe IC maps are 4D files, with spatial dimensions matching the input file and the fourth dimension matching the number of non-artifactual components in the model (below, 105).\n\n```bash\n$ fslinfo sub-10003_ses-V1_task-cuff_run-01_bold_ic_maps.nii.gz\ndata_type\tFLOAT32\ndim1\t\t97\ndim2\t\t115\ndim3\t\t97\ndim4\t\t105\ndatatype\t16\npixdim1\t\t2.000000\npixdim2\t\t2.000000\npixdim3\t\t2.000000\npixdim4\t\t0.000000\ncal_max\t\t0.000000\ncal_min\t\t0.000000\nfile_type\tNIFTI-1+\n```\n\nThe timecourse files are 2D arrays, with columns corresponding to the number of non-artifacual components in the model and the rows corresponding to each timepoint[^gift-timepoints].\n\n[^gift-timepoints]: The original fMRIs have 450 timepoints, but in all analyses, the first 15 are excluded to remove Non-Steady State volumes. For details, see @sadil_acute_2024.\n\n```bash\n$ fslinfo sub-10003_ses-V1_task-cuff_run-01_bold_timecourses.nii.gz\ndata_type\tFLOAT32\ndim1\t\t435\ndim2\t\t105\ndim3\t\t1\ndim4\t\t1\ndatatype\t16\npixdim1\t\t2.000000\npixdim2\t\t2.000000\npixdim3\t\t2.000000\npixdim4\t\t0.000000\ncal_max\t\t0.000000\ncal_min\t\t0.000000\nfile_type\tNIFTI-1+\n```\n\nMany analyses will be based on either these spatial maps or timecourses [but see @sec-additional-gift]. For example, let's use these components to search for a possible effect of systematic low-frequency oscillations [@tong_low_2019]. These oscillations have been hypothesized to increase the total functional connectivity (that is, the sum of the all connectivity between each pair of components) throughout a scan [@korponay_brain_2024]. So, does the moment-by-moment total connectivity increase during a scan?\n\nFirst, define a helper function for estimating the rolling correlation. We'll use a window of 25 timepoints, which, given the 0.8 second Repetition Time, corresponds to 20 seconds.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndo_cor <- function(x, y, width = 25) {\n  rho <- roll_cor(x, y, width = width)\n  tibble(rho = rho, t = 1:length(x))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, add a helper function for taking \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_total_correlation <- function(file) {\n  timecourse <- readNifti(file)\n  crossing(\n    src = 1:ncol(timecourse),\n    dst = 1:ncol(timecourse)\n  ) |>\n    filter(dst > src) |>\n    mutate(\n      correlations = map2(\n        src,\n        dst,\n        ~ do_cor(timecourse[, .x], timecourse[, .y])\n      )\n    ) |>\n    unnest(correlations) |>\n    na.omit() |> # NAs caused by not having enough timepoints for window\n    summarise(total_connectivity = sum(atanh(rho)), .by = t)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nUse these helper functions to calculate the total connectivity for each REST1 scan.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd <- crossing(\n  file = dir_ls(\n    \"data/gift/derivatives/gift-neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi\",\n    recurse = TRUE,\n    glob = \"*rest_run-01*timecourses.nii.gz\"\n  )\n) |>\n  mutate(total_connectivity = map(file, get_total_correlation)) |>\n  unnest(total_connectivity)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd now, plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd |>\n  mutate(t = t * 0.8) |> # convert to seconds\n  summarise(med_total_connectivity = median(total_connectivity), .by = t) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = t, y = med_total_connectivity)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  ylab(\"Total Connectivity\") +\n  xlab(\"Time (seconds)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Median Total Connectivity. Total connectivity is the sum of the atanh of all pairs of correlations. The median is taken across scans.](gift_files/figure-html/mainplot-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFor the REST1 scans, the sum of connectivity appears to increase by around $150/130 = 15\\%$, which is consistent with the presence of systematic low-frequency oscillations.\n\n### Additional Outputs {#sec-additional-gift}\n\nFor analyses that require the full set of raw GIFT outputs, please see the most deeply nested \"derivatives folder\"\n\n```bash\nls mris/derivatives/gift/derivatives/gift-neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi/derivatives | head\nsub-10003_ses-V1_task-cuff_run-01_bold_neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi\nsub-10003_ses-V1_task-rest_run-01_bold_neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi\nsub-10003_ses-V1_task-rest_run-02_bold_neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi\nsub-10008_ses-V1_task-cuff_run-01_bold_neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi\nsub-10008_ses-V1_task-rest_run-01_bold_neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi\nsub-10008_ses-V1_task-rest_run-02_bold_neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi\nsub-10010_ses-V1_task-cuff_run-01_bold_neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi\nsub-10010_ses-V1_task-cuff_run-02_bold_neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi\nsub-10010_ses-V1_task-rest_run-01_bold_neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi\nsub-10010_ses-V1_task-rest_run-02_bold_neuromark_fmri_2.1_modelorder-multi\n```\n\nIn this folder, there is a single subfolder corresponding to the outputs for each individual run[^runwise]. For details on these files, please see the [the GIFT documentation](https://github.com/trendscenter/gift). \n\n[^runwise]: Although GIFT can facilitate group-level analyses, the A2CPS derivatives include only the run-level components.\n\n\n## Considerations While Working on the Project\n\n### Variability Across Scanners\n\nMany MRI biomarkers exhibit variability across the scanners, which may confound some analyses. For an up-to-date assessment of the issue and overview of current thinking, please see [Confluence](https://a2cps.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/176619539/Imaging+Harmonization). \n\n\n### Data Quality\n\nAs with any MRI derivative, all pipeline derivatives have been included. This means that products were included regardless of their quality, and so some products may have been generated from images that are known to have poor quality---rated \"red\", or incomparable. For details on the ratings and how to exclude them, see @sec-rawdata-mri-qc-joining. Additionally, extensive QC has not yet been performed on the derivatives themselves, and so there may be cases where pipelines produced atypical outputs. For an overview of planned checks, see [Confluence](https://a2cps.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/262471688/Image+Processing+Checks). \n\n\n### Data Generation\n\nThe GIFT outputs were generated by the [gift_app](https://github.com/a2cps/mri_imaging_pipeline/tree/master/gift_app) component of the A2CPS Imaging pipeline. Prior to NeuroMark, the resting-state fMRI data were minimally preprocessed (@sadil_acute_2024), and then resampled to 2.4mm isotropic voxel size to ensure identical dimensions across all subjects. After resampling, volumes were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum of 6mm. NeuroMark was then applied separately for each resting-state run from each subject and separately for each template. The NeuroMark pipeline included the following configuration options: brain masking using the default mask plus intracranial volume, coregistration of the functional data to a functional template in MNI space (separate from the registration performed during minimal preprocessing), removal of the first 15 volumes (i.e., dummy scans), bandpass filtering (0.01-0.15Hz), removal of the mean per timepoint, multivariate-objective optimization ICA with reference [@du_group_2013], and z-score scaling of results. The NeuroMark outputs include, separately for each template applied to each resting-state run from each subject, the timecourses and spatial maps of each intrinsic component network, functional network connectivity estimates, summary reports, and visualizations of the networks.\n\n### Citations\n\nIf you use these products in your analyses, please cite the relevant papers written by members [TReNDS](https://trendscenter.org/data/).\n\nIn publications or presentations including data from A2CPS, please include the following statement as attribution:\n\n> Data were provided [in part] by the A2CPS Consortium funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund, which is managed by the Office of the Director (OD)/ Office of Strategic Coordination (OSC).

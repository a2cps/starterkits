In this example, a Data Package has been created that includes the rawdata. You will see a list of files like the following\n\n```bash\n$ tree -L 2\n.\n├── dataset_collection.txt\n├── datastructure_manifest.txt\n├── experiments\n│   ├── experiment_2652\n│   └── experiment_2655\n├── image03\n│   ├── corral-secure\n│   └── manifest-files\n├── image03.txt\n├── md5_values.txt\n├── package_file_metadata_1235008.txt.gz\n├── package_info.txt\n└── README.pdf\n```\n\n## Data Structures\n\nThis is raw imaging data, and so it is stored in the [image03 Data Structure](https://nda.nih.gov/data-structure/image03) (link goes to data dictionary). Metadata is stored in the `image03.txt`. This is where you will find information such as participant age, participant sex, and scan acquisition date. \n\nNote that, as with downloads of all NDA data structures, the second line of this table includes a partial data dictionary. That is, the header is on the first line, and the first row of data is on the third line.\n\n## Imaging Files\n\nThe imaging files are underneath `image03`. \n\n```bash\n$ ls image03/corral-secure/projects/A2CPS/products/consortium-data/pre-surgery/mris/bids/ | head\ndataset_description.json\nREADME\nsessions.json\nsub-10003\nsub-10005\nsub-10008\nsub-10010\nsub-10011\nsub-10013\n```\n\nThe contents of that folder match the contents described in @sec-raw-mri (note that the aggregated table `participants.tsv` is not included in the NDA download, as the information is available in `image03.txt`).\n\n## Experiments\n\nThe rawdata folder includes an “experiments“ folder, which provides some information on how the two types of fMRI scans were collected.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|Experiment              |Files                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|:-----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|experiment_2652 (rfMRI) |{{< downloadthis files/experiment_2652.xml dname=\"experiment_2652\" label=\"experiment_2652.xml\" >}} {{< downloadthis files/A2CPS_rest.txt dname=\"A2CPS_rest\" label=\"A2CPS_rest.txt\" >}} |\n|experiment_2655 (tfMRI) |{{< downloadthis files/experiment_2655.xml dname=\"experiment_2655\" label=\"experiment_2655.xml\" >}} {{< downloadthis files/A2CPS_cuff.txt dname=\"A2CPS_cuff\" label=\"A2CPS_cuff.txt\" >}} |\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Additional NDA Metadata\n\nThe rest of the files are metadata associated with the storage of the dataset in the NDA or information about the Data Package. Most users will not need to interact with these files unless something has gone wrong with the download.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n|File/Directory                                                                                                                               |Description/Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|{{< downloadthis files/dataset_collection.txt dname=\"dataset_collection\" label=\"dataset_collection.txt\" >}}                                  |Table with identifiers relating to how the data were uploaded                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|{{< downloadthis files/datastructure_manifest.txt dname=\"datastructure_manifest\" label=\"datastructure_manifest.txt\" >}}                      |Table with partial information about how the files are stored on the NDA AWS S3 bucket.

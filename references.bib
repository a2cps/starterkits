abstract = {We mapped functional and structural brain networks for more than 40,000 UK Biobank participants. Structural connectivity was estimated with tractography and diffusion MRI. Resting-state functional MRI was used to infer regional functional connectivity. We provide high-quality structural and functional connectomes for multiple parcellation granularities, several alternative measures of interregional connectivity, and a variety of common data pre-processing techniques, yielding more than one million connectomes in total and requiring more than 200,000 h of compute time. For a single subject, we provide 28 out-of-the-box versions of structural and functional brain networks, allowing users to select, e.g., the parcellation and connectivity measure that best suit their research goals. Furthermore, we provide code and intermediate data for the time-efficient reconstruction of more than 1000 different versions of a subject’s connectome based on an array of methodological choices. All connectomes are available via the UK Biobank data-sharing platform and our connectome mapping pipelines are openly available. In this report, we describe our connectome resource in detail for users, outline key considerations in developing an efficient pipeline to map an unprecedented number of connectomes, and report on the quality control procedures that were completed to ensure connectome reliability and accuracy. We demonstrate that our structural and functional connectivity matrices meet a number of quality control checks and replicate previously established findings in network neuroscience. We envisage that our resource will enable new studies of the human connectome in health, disease, and aging at an unprecedented scale.}

	abstract = {The Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) project is a large-scale, multi-site initiative aimed at identifying biomarkers and biosignatures that predict the transition from acute to chronic pain. The project is collecting multimodal, longitudinal data from over 2,500 individuals at risk for developing chronic pain after surgery. Here we describe the neuroimaging component of A2CPS, including the acquisition protocols, processing pipelines, and contents of the initial data release. The imaging protocol includes structural, diffusion, resting-state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Data are collected across multiple clinical sites using different scanner manufacturers, with attention to protocol harmonization and quality control. The processing pipeline integrates several established neuroimaging tools to extract potential biomarkers, including measures of brain structure, connectivity, and pain-related neural signatures. The first data release includes pre-surgical imaging data for 595 participants, with high quality ratings across modalities (98.7\% of sMRI, 99.8\% of dMRI, and 94.6\% of fMRI images were rated as acceptable or better). Initial analyses demonstrate expected relationships between brain-derived measures and clinical variables, such as associations between brain age and psychological factors. This dataset represents a valuable resource for both pain research and neuroimaging methods development, with future releases planned to include additional participants and expanded analysis pipelines and processed data derivatives.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

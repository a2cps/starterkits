As with any MRI derivative, all pipeline derivatives have been included. This means that products were included regardless of their quality, and so some products are known to have poor quality--rated "red" or incomparable. For details on the ratings and how to exclude them, see @sec-rawdata-mri-qc-joining.

Currently, no QC has been performed on the underlying segmentations and parcellations. With adequate sample sizes, results based on whole-atlas FreeSurfer measurements are generally robust, although there are individual regions that may warrant close inspection (e.g., [McCarthy et al. 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2015.00379), [Vahermaa et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120306)). Moreover, it remains unclear the extent to which FreeSurfer's accuracy persists over the wide range of demographics found in the A2CPS dataset. The Imaging DIRC is actively exploring these aspects of quality.

As with any MRI derivative, all pipeline derivatives have been included. This means that products were included regardless of their quality, and so some products may have been generated from images that are known to have poor quality---rated "red", or incomparable. For details on the ratings and how to exclude them, see @sec-rawdata-mri-qc-joining. Additionally, extensive QC has not yet been performed on the derivatives themselves, and so there may be cases where pipelines produced atypical outputs. For an overview of planned checks, see [Confluence](https://a2cps.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/262471688/Image+Processing+Checks).

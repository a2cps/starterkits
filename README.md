# A2CPS Starter Kits

A2CPS Starter Kits are brief tutorials about components of A2CPS data. The kits are aimed at researchers accustomed to working with some specialized data format, but not necessarily the modality in question (e.g., someone familiar with genetics working with neuroimaging data). Starter kits are expected to be useful during the planning stage of a project and while first accessing the data.
